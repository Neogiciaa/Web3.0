This is my first blog exercise with HTML and CSS based on this Figma: 
https://www.figma.com/design/87gRFe00lSsdbnQx83jufY/FLEX-GRID-RESPONSIVE?node-id=0-1 

A great way to practice basics and media queries !

## Start project

After cloning this repository, you will need to move inside project folder using:

```bash
cd web3.0
```

Then here are three ways to start it:

1. Drag and drop `index.html` file into your web browser

2. For WebStorm users → Click the green play button at the top of the IDE with the `index.html` file open

3. For VSCode users → Use the Live Server extension to open a local server with fast refresh
